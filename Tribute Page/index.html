            <p>Ada Lovelace (1815–1852), a mathematician and computing pioneer, wrote the first algorithm for Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine—becoming the world’s first computer programmer. Her visionary work laid the foundation for modern computing.</p>

          <p>Ada Lovelace was a pioneering British mathematician, computer scientist, and writer, best known for her groundbreaking work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer that laid the foundation for modern computing. While translating an article about Babbage's invention from a French journal into English, Lovelace added her own extensive notes, which Babbage later incorporated into the final publication. Among these notes was the first-ever algorithm designed to be executed by a machine—an achievement that earned her the distinction of being the world’s first computer programmer.</p>

            <p>Ada Lovelace earned the nickname "Enchantress of Numbers" from Charles Babbage for her mathematical brilliance.</p>
